The Face Control Projection Tool projects a fully constructed control hierarchy (including optional control shapes, offset nulls, joints, etc) onto any mesh surface based on the location of your mouse pointer relative to the mesh.

Using the options in the tool UI, you can mirror across any axis (and choose the point used as the center for mirroring), choose from a variety of default control shapes or use your own, and choose how the hierarchy for your controls looks by enabling or disabling offset group and joint creation.

This tool was developed to speed up the facial rigging process â€“ although ultimately it should be used for whatever purpose for which you find it useful.
